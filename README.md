# Reproduced PINN Architectures for Saint-Venant Equations

This repository reproduces the **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** architectures presented in *Nazari et al. (2024)* for modeling 1D Saint-Venant equations.

---

## üìò Overview
The goal of this project is to **replicate and analyze** the three architectures (A, B, and C) proposed by Nazari, focusing on:
- Parameter learning stability for *S‚ÇÄ* and *n*  
- The effects of noisy derivative data on inverse prediction  
- The impact of MAP regularization and loss weighting

## üß† Architectures Implemented
1. **Architecture A (Data-Assisted)** ‚Äî Uses forward-difference derivatives and learns parameters jointly.  
2. **Architecture B (Pure AD)** ‚Äî Relies entirely on automatic differentiation for gradient computation.  
3. **Architecture C (MAP Regularization)** ‚Äî Incorporates a Maximum A Posteriori prior to stabilize parameter learning.

## üß© Model Description
- **Governing equations:** 1D Saint-Venant (shallow water) equations  
- **Parameters learned:** Channel slope (*S‚ÇÄ*) and Manning‚Äôs coefficient (*n*)  
- **Loss components:**  
  - Data Loss (MSE between predicted and reference flow variables)  
  - PDE Loss (MSE of continuity and momentum residuals)  
  - Regularization (optional MAP prior)
